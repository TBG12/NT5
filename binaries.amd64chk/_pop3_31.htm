<H1>Create a Mailbox</H1>

<P>For a user to receive e-mail, you must create a unique mailbox for that user. If you are using Active Directory integrated authentication or local Windows accounts authentication, you can also create an associated user for the mailbox.</P>


<P class="labelproc"><B>To create a mailbox</B></P>

<OL type="1">
	<LI>On the primary navigation bar, click <b>E-mail</b>.</LI>
	<LI>Click <b>Domains and Mailboxes</b>.</LI>
	<LI>In the <b>Name</b> column, select the check box next to the domain that contains the mailbox you want to create.</LI>
	<LI>Click <b>Mailboxes</b>.</LI>
	<LI>Click <b>New</b>.</LI>
	<LI>Click <b>Create associated user for this mailbox</b> if you are using Active Directory or local Windows accounts authentication. You must select this check box if you are using Active Directory integrated authentication or local Windows accounts authentication when creating a mailbox. If the check box is already selected, clear it only if an account already exists with the same name as the mailbox you want to create.</li>
	<LI>In <b>User Name</b>, type the name of the mailbox to be created.</LI>
	<LI>In <b>Password</b>, type the password for the new mailbox.</LI>
	<LI>In <b>Confirm Password</b>, retype the password you entered in <B>Password</b>, and click <b>OK</b>.</LI>

<LI>To perform this procedure, you must be a member of the Administrators group on the local computer, or you must have been delegated the appropriate authority. If the computer is joined to a domain, members of the Domain Admins group might be able to perform this procedure.</LI>

<LI>The <b>Create associated user for this mailbox</b> option is only available if the server is using Active Directory integrated or local Windows accounts authentication. </LI>

<LI>If you are using Active Directory integrated authentication, you must log on to the Active Directory domain, not the local computer, to perform this procedure. </LI>

<LI>The maximum length for a mailbox name is 20 characters for local Windows accounts authentication, and 64 characters for encrypted password file authentication or Active Directory integrated authentication. The minimum length is 1 character. 
 </LI>


<LI>If you are using Active Directory integrated authentication or local Windows accounts authentication, <b>Password</b> and <b>Confirm Password</b> are unavailable until you select <b>Create associated user for this mailbox</b>.</LI>

<LI>If you are using Active Directory integrated authentication and have multiple POP3 e-mail domains, when you create a mailbox, consider whether the mailbox you 
are creating has the same name as an existing mailbox in another POP3 e-mail domain. 

<P>Each mailbox is associated with an Active Directory user account, which has both a user logon 
name and pre-Windows&nbsp;2000 user logon name. The user logon name is the name of the Active Directory user account and the POP3 mailbox. Usually, the pre-Windows&nbsp;2000 user 
logon name is the same as the user logon name.</P>

<P>If, however, you try to create a mailbox and user account when there is an existing user account with 
the same pre-Windows&nbsp;2000 user logon name, a naming conflict will occur. Active Directory does not support multiple accounts with the same pre-Windows&nbsp;2000 user logon name.</P> 
<P>If there is a naming conflict, the mailbox name and e-mail address will not be affected, but the account's pre-Windows&nbsp;2000 logon name will be modified to avoid any naming conflict with the 
existing account. If you are using Secure Password Authentication, and a naming conflict has occurred, the pre-Windows&nbsp;2000 logon name must be used for e-mail client authentication.</P>  

<P>You can determine the modified logon name by logging on locally to the server, by connecting to the server using Terminal Services, or by logging on to another computer in the Active Directory domain and going to the <b>Active Directory Users and Computers</b> snap-in in  <b>Administrative Tools</b>.</P> 

<P>Go to the <b>Users</b> folder, right-click the user account, and then click <b>Properties</b>. Click the <b>Account</b> tab. The modified account name appears in 
<b>User logon name (pre-Windows&nbsp;2000)</b>.</P> 

<P>You must note the pre-Windows&nbsp;2000 logon name and provide it to the user. For more information about Secure Password Authentication, see <A HREF="_POP3_15.htm">Secure Password Authentication</A>.</P></li>
