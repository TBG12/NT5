    you also grant third parties, without charge, only those
    patent rights necessary to enable their products,
    technologies or services to use or interface with any
    specific parts of a Microsoft Offering that incorporate the
    Feedback; and (c) you will not give Microsoft Feedback
    subject to license terms that seek to require any Microsoft
    Offering that incorporates or is derived from any Feedback,
    or any other Microsoft intellectual property, to be

    performance testing.

 7. DEMAND FOR EXAMINATION.  Microsoft hereby requests that you
    fully examine the Software during the term of this EULA so 
    that you will be fully familiar with it before obtaining a
    copy of the non-evaluation version of the Software.
    Only your full examination now will determine whether or not
    the non-evaluation version will be merchantable or fit for 
    your particular purposes.

 8. COST OF TESTING.  There is no charge to you for evaluation of
    the Software.  Microsoft will, however, charge you for
    shipping and handling expenses relating to shipment of the
    Software to your place of business.  If the Software is
    returned by you, you will also be responsible for paying
    the return shipping expenses.

 9. AUTOMATIC INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.  
    The Software features described below are enabled by default
    to connect via the Internet to Microsoft computer systems 
    automatically, without separate notice to you.  
    You consent to the operation of these features, unless you
    choose to switch them off or not use them.
    Microsoft does not obtain personally identifiable information
    through any of these features.  For more information about
    these features, please see your Software documentation or
    the Microsoft online support site.

    a. Windows Update Features.  Under the Software's default
    configuration, if you connect a device to your Server and
    the correct device driver is not available on your Server,
    then Windows Update features on your Server (including
    Device Manager and the Plug & Play CDM Module)
    automatically attempt to check Microsoft computer systems
    via the Internet for the correct device driver.  Having
    this happen automatically makes Plug-and-Play installation
    of new hardware a better experience for customers.  You may
    switch off Windows Update's automatic driver
    checking feature.

    b. Web Content Features.  Under the Software's default
    configuration, if you are connected to the Internet,
    several features of the Software are enabled by default to
    retrieve content from Microsoft computer systems and
    display it to you.  When you activate such a feature, it
    uses standard Internet protocols, which transmit the type
    of operating system, browser and language code of your
    Server to the Microsoft computer system so that the
    content can be viewed properly from your Server.  These
    features only operate when you activate them, and you may
    choose to switch them off or not use them.  Examples of 
    these features include Windows Catalog, Search Assistant,
    and the Headlines and Search features of Help and Support
    Center.

    c. Digital Certificates.  Use of certificates based on
    the X.509 standard is an important security feature of the
    Software.  Certain functions of the X.509 implementation
    (for example, certificate revocation checking and
    certificate path building) connect via the Internet to
    computer systems belonging to Microsoft and other digital
    certificate authorities to check the validity of digital
    certificates that you receive from third parties during
    certain Internet-based operations (for example,
    communications secured with SSL or IPsec, mail secured with
    S/MIME, and smartcard authentication).  In accordance with
    the X.509 standard, the Software automatically retrieves
    user certificates and certificate revocation lists when you
    attempt to access certificate protected content. 
    Additionally, the Software's Auto Root Update feature will
    occasionally update the list of trusted certificate 
    authorities. Auto Root Update is an optional feature; you
    can uninstall it if you do not desire it to function.  
    The other security operations based on the X.509 standard
    can be prevented from operating by blocking Server Internet
    access.

    d. Windows Media Digital Rights Management.  Content
    providers are using the digital rights management
    technology for Windows Media contained in this Software 
    ("WM-DRM") to protect the integrity of their content 
    ("Secure Content") so that their intellectual property,
    including copyright, in such content is not misappropriated.
    Portions of this Software and third party applications such
    as media players use WM-DRM to play Secure Content ("WM-DRM
    Software").  If the WM-DRM Software's security has been
    compromised, owners of Secure Content ("Secure Content 
    Owners") may request that Microsoft revoke the WM-DRM 
    Software's right to copy, display and/or play Secure
    Content.  Revocation does not alter the WM-DRM Software's
    ability to play unprotected content.  A list of revoked 
    WM-DRM Software is sent to your computer whenever you
    download a license for Secure Content from the Internet. 
    Microsoft may, in conjunction with such license, also
    download revocation lists onto your computer on behalf
    of Secure Content Owners.  Secure Content Owners may also 
    require you to upgrade some of the WM-DRM components in 
    this Software ("WM-DRM Upgrades") before accessing their
    content.  When you attempt to play such content, WM-DRM 
    Software built by Microsoft will notify you that a WM-DRM
    Upgrade is required and then ask for your consent before 
    the WM-DRM Upgrade is downloaded.  WM-DRM Software built 
    by third parties may do the same.  If you decline the 
    upgrade, you will not be able to access content that 
    requires the WM-DRM Upgrade; however, you will still be 
    able to access unprotected content and Secure Content that
    does not require the upgrade.  WM-DRM features that access
    the Internet, such as acquiring new licenses and/or 
    performing a required WM-DRM Upgrade, can be switched off.
    When these features are switched off, you will still be 
    able to play Secure Content if you have a valid license 
    for such content already stored on your computer.

    e. Windows Media Player.  Some features of Windows Media
    Player automatically contact Microsoft computer systems if
    you use Windows Media Player or specific features of it: 
    features that (i) check for new codecs if your Server does
    not have the correct ones for content you attempt to play
    (this feature may be switched off), and (ii) check for new
    versions of Windows Media Player (this feature will operate
    only when you are using Windows Media Player).

10. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS; OTHER RESTRICTIONS.
    The Software is protected by copyright and
    other intellectual property laws and treaties.  Microsoft
    or its suppliers own the title, copyright, and other
    intellectual property rights in the Software.  The Software
    is licensed, not sold.  Microsoft reserves all rights not
    expressly granted to you in this EULA.  Reverse engineering,
    decompiling, or disassembling the Software is prohibited, 
    except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly
    permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation.
    Renting, leasing, or lending the Software (including 
    providing commercial hosting services) is also prohibited.

11. PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES

    product support services related to the Software.  Use of
    any such support services is governed by the Microsoft
    policies and programs described in the user manual, in

    b. Consent to Use of Data.  You agree that Microsoft and its
    affiliates may collect and use technical information
    gathered as part of the support services provided to you,
    if any, related to the Software.  Microsoft may use this
    information solely to improve our products or to provide

    identifies you.

    of the Software.  Microsoft does not control the third
    party sites, and Microsoft is not responsible for the
    contents of any third party sites, any links contained
    in third party sites, or any changes or updates to third
    party sites.  Microsoft is not responsible for web-casting
    or any other form of transmission received from any third
    party sites. Microsoft is providing you these links to third
    party sites only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any 
    link does not imply an endorsement by Microsoft of the third
    party site.

13. SOFTWARE TRANSFER.  You may move the Software
    to a different computer on your premises.  After the transfer,
    you must completely remove the Software from the former
    computer.  You may not transfer the Software or this EULA
    to any third party.
