THIS SOFTWARE DOES NOT TRANSMIT ANY
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION FROM YOUR
SERVER TO MICROSOFT COMPUTER SYSTEMS WITHOUT
YOUR CONSENT.

 1. GENERAL.  This EULA is a legal agreement between you (either
    an individual or a single entity) and Microsoft Corporation
    ("Microsoft").  This EULA governs the Software, which
    includes computer software (including online and electronic
    documentation) and any associated media and printed
    materials.  This EULA applies to updates, supplements, add
    -on components, and Internet-based services components of
    the Software that Microsoft may provide or make available
    to you unless Microsoft provides other terms with the
    update, supplement, add-on component, or Internet-based
    services component.  Microsoft reserves the right to
    discontinue any Internet-based services provided to you or
    made available to you through the use of the Software. 
    This EULA also governs any product support services
    relating to the Software except as may be included in
    another agreement between you and Microsoft.  An amendment
    or addendum to this EULA may accompany the Software.  The
    Software may contain the following:

    * "Server Software" provides services or functionality on
      your server (your computers capable of running the Server
      Software are "Servers"); and

    * "Device Software" allows a single personal computer,
      workstation, terminal, handheld computer, pager,
      telephone, personal digital assistant, or other
      electronic device ("Device") to access or use the Server
      Software.

 2. GRANT OF LICENSE.  Microsoft grants you the following rights,
    conditioned on your compliance with all the terms and
    conditions of this EULA:

    a. Installation, Server Software.  You may install only one
    copy of Server Software on a single Server, even if
    multiple copies of Server Software (for example, 32-bit and
    64-bit versions) are included in the Software.  Features
    supported on 32-bit and 64-bit versions, including some
    features mentioned in this EULA, may not be identical or
    available in both versions;  please refer to product
    documentation for a list of specific features included with
    each version.  Separate component parts of the Server
    Software may not be used on more than one Server.  An
    additional license is required if you install another copy
    of the Server Software on the same Server (whether in a
    separate partition, by using server emulation software, or
    otherwise) or to install or run a copy of the Server
    Software on a different Server (for example, a Server
    employed for backup or fail-over support).

    b. Processor Rights.  You may use Microsoft Windows Server
    2003, Standard Edition, with up to four CPUs of the Server
    at any one time, or Microsoft Windows Server 2003,
    Enterprise Edition, with up to eight CPUs of the Server at
    any one time.

    c. Installation, Device Software.  You may install and use
    the Device Software on any Device solely to access or use
    the Server Software.

    d. Mandatory Activation.  To reduce software piracy,
    Microsoft requires 32-bit versions of the Server Software
    to be activated.  Microsoft will not collect any personally
    identifiable information from your Server or any Device
    during the activation process without your consent. 
    Activation of your copy of the Software in the manner
    described during its setup sequence is required; otherwise,
    the license rights granted under this EULA are limited to
    the first thirty (30) days after you first install the
    Software.  You may activate the Software through the use
    of the Internet or telephone; toll charges may apply.  You
    may also need to reactivate the Software if you modify your
    computer hardware or alter the Software.  If you choose
    Internet activation, the Software will contact Microsoft
    computer systems over the Internet to conduct an
    authentication process to confirm that you have a licensed
    copy of the Software.  You agree to allow the Software to
    conduct this authentication process.  If you have an
    unlicensed copy of the Software, you are not allowed to
    install the Software or future Software updates. 
    Additional information about activation is available online
    at the Microsoft support site.

 3. CLIENT ACCESS LICENSES ("CALs").  The
    Software licensing model consists of an operating system
    license and incremental CALs, so that the total cost for
    the Software scales with usage.  Several CAL types and
    licensing modes are available to suit your individual needs.

    a. Windows Server 2003 Client Access License ("Windows CAL")
    Requirements.  In addition to the license for the Server
    Software, you must acquire a Windows CAL for each
    individual person ("User") or Device that accesses or uses
    the Server Software, whether directly or through a
    Multiplexing Service (defined below).  For example, a
    Windows CAL is required for each User or Device that uses
    any of the following services of the Server Software: 

    * authentication services (when user or application
      credentials are exchanged between the Server Software
      and a User or Device),

    * file services (accessing or managing files or disk
      storage),

    * printing services (printing to a printer managed by the
      Server Software), or

    * remote access service (accessing the Server from a remote
      location through a communications link, including a
      virtual private network).

    However, you do not need to acquire a Windows CAL for any 
    User or Device that accesses the Server Software solely 
    through the Internet and is not authenticated or otherwise 
    individually distinguished by the Server Software or a 
    Multiplexing Service (for example, by browsing a public 
    website anonymously).  A "Multiplexing Service" is a software
    application or service accessing or using the Server Software
    at the request of or on behalf of a User or Device.

    Further, you do not need to acquire a Windows CAL for any 
    User or Device that has a valid Small Business Server 
    (SBS) 2003 CAL, is accessing Server Software that is not 
    operating as a domain controller, and is within the same 
    Small Business Server domain.

    b. Types of Windows CALs.  Two different types of Windows
    CALs are available to you:  "Device" and "User."  Each
    Windows Device CAL permits one Device (used by any User)
    to access or use the Server Software.  Each Windows User
    CAL permits one User (using any Device) to access or use
    the Server Software.  You may use a mix of Windows Device
    CALs and Windows User CALs simultaneously with the Server
    Software.

    c. Windows CAL Licensing Modes.  At your option, you may use
    Windows CALs with the Server Software in either "Per Device
    or Per User" or "Per Server" mode.

       (i) In Per Device or Per User mode, a separate Windows CAL
       is required for each Device or User that accesses or
       uses Server Software on any of your Servers.  If you
       choose Per Device or Per User mode, the choice is
       permanent.  In this mode, you may reassign a Windows
       CAL from one Device to another Device, or from one
       User to another User, provided the reassignment is
       made either (A) permanently away from the one Device
       or User or (B) temporarily to accommodate the use of
       the Windows CAL by a loaner Device while a permanent
       Device is out of service, or the use of the Window CAL 
       by a temporary worker while a regular employee is absent.

       (ii) In Per Server mode, the maximum number of Devices and
       Users that may simultaneously access or use Server
       Software installed on a particular Server equals the
       number of Windows CALs (of either type) that you acquire
       and designate for use exclusively with that Server. 
       You have the one-time right to change your use of the
       Server Software from Per Server mode to Per Device or 
       Per User mode.  If you do so, you may apply the same 
       number of Windows CALs you acquired for use in Per Server
       mode in Per Device or Per User mode instead.

    d. Terminal Server Client Access License ("TS CAL")
    Requirements.  In addition to a Windows CAL, if you wish
    to conduct a Windows Session, you must acquire a TS CAL for
    each User or Device.  A "Windows Session" means a session
    during which Server Software hosts a graphical user
    interface on a Device (whether via the TS component of
    the Server Software or via other technology).

    e. Types of TS CALs; TS CAL Licensing Modes.  Similar to
    Windows CALs, two different TS CALs are available to you: 
    "Device" and "User."  Each TS Device CAL permits one Device
    (used by any User) to conduct Windows Sessions on any of
    your Servers.  Each TS User CAL permits one User (using any
    Device) to conduct Windows Sessions on any of your Servers.
    You may use a mix of TS Device CALs and TS User CALs
    simultaneously with the Server Software.

       (i) In Per Device or Per User mode, a separate TS CAL is
       required for each Device or User that accesses or uses
       Server Software on any of your Servers.  You may
       reassign a TS CAL from one Device to another Device,
       or from one User to another User, provided the
       reassignment is made either (A) permanently away from
       the one Device or User or (B) temporarily to accommodate
       the use of the TS CAL by a loaner Device while a
       permanent Device is out of service, or the use of the 
       TS CAL by a temporary worker while a regular employee 
       is absent.

       (ii) Windows Sessions are not allowed in Per Server mode.

    f. Premium Windows Server Services.  Microsoft may
    subsequently create new software functionality ("Premium
    Services") that you may wish to use with this version of
    the Software.  To make these Premium Services available to
    you for use with this version of the Software, Microsoft
    may provide them under additional license terms and may
    charge additional access license fees for you to install
    and use them, if you choose.

    g. Additional CAL Requirements.

       (i) Single Licensee.  Windows CALs, TS CALs, and any
       future Premium Services CALs that you acquire may not
       be used in conjunction with Server Software licensed
       to anyone other than you.

       (ii) Version Matching.  Each required CAL must be version
       Windows Server 2003 or a later version.

       (iii) Administration.  Up to two Users or Devices may
       simultaneously access or use the Server Software solely
       for administration of the Server Software, without
       acquiring any CALs.  You do not need a TS CAL when
       attaching to or mirroring the single Console Session.
       The "Console Session" is the Windows Session that
       is conducted through the designated primary
       keyboard and display device (or similar peripherals).

 4. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND
    LIMITATIONS

    a. Other Licenses.  Your use of software applications
    installed on the Server, accessed through the Server, or
    providing application-sharing functionality may require
    additional licenses.  Please consult the license agreement
    accompanying such software.

    b. Component Data Storage.  The 32-bit version of the
    Software contains components that use the data storage
    technology known as Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine 
    ("MSDE").  All copies and instances of MSDE contained in or
    installed by those Software components may be used only by
    those Software components.  Any such copy or instance of
    MSDE may not be accessed or used for any other purpose. 
    For example, applications may not be created or run on the
    Software if they access or use the services or
    functionality of any copy or instance of MSDE contained in
    or installed by those Software components.  In addition,
    any MSDE network library files that are disabled at the time
    you first install the Software may not be re-enabled.

    c. Automatic Internet-Based Services.  The Software features
    described below are enabled by default to connect via the
    Internet to Microsoft computer systems automatically,
    without separate notice to you.  You consent to the
    operation of these features, unless you choose to switch
    them off or not use them.  Microsoft does not obtain
    personally identifiable information through any of these
    features.  For more information about these features,
    please see your Software documentation or the Microsoft 
    online support site.

       (i) Windows Update Features.  Under the Software's default
       configuration, if you connect a device to your Server
       and the correct device driver is not available on your
       Server, then Windows Update features on your Server
       (including Device Manager and the Plug & Play CDM
       Module) automatically attempt to check Microsoft
       computer systems via the Internet for the correct device
       driver.  Having this happen automatically makes Plug-and-
       Play installation of new hardware a better experience
       for customers.  You may switch off Windows Update's 
       automatic driver checking feature.

       (ii) Web Content Features.  Under the Software's default
       configuration, if you are connected to the Internet,
       several features of the Software are enabled by default
       to retrieve content from Microsoft computer systems
       and display it to you.  When you activate such a
       feature, it uses standard Internet protocols, which
       transmit the type of operating system, browser and
       language code of your Server to the Microsoft computer
       system so that the content can be viewed properly from
       your Server.  These features only operate when you
       activate them, and you may choose to switch them off
       or not use them.  Examples of these features include 
       Windows Catalog, Search Assistant, and the Headlines and 
       Search features of Help and Support Center.

       (iii) Digital Certificates.  Use of certificates based on
       the X.509 standard is an important security feature
       of the Software.  Certain functions of the X.509
       implementation (for example, certificate revocation
       checking and certificate path building) connect via
       the Internet to computer systems belonging to Microsoft
       and other digital certificate authorities to check
       the validity of digital certificates that you receive
       from third parties during certain Internet-based
       operations (for example, communications secured with
       SSL or IPsec, mail secured with S/MIME, and smartcard
       authentication).  In accordance with the X.509 standard,
       the Software automatically retrieves user certificates
       and certificate revocation lists when you attempt to
       access certificate protected content.  Additionally,
       the Software's Auto Root Update feature will occasionally
       update the list of trusted certificate authorities. 
       Auto Root Update is an optional feature; you can uninstall
       it if you do not desire it to function.  The other 
       security operations based on the X.509 standard can be 
       prevented from operating by blocking Server Internet 
       access.

       (iv) Windows Media Digital Rights Management.  Content
       providers are using the digital rights management
       technology for Windows Media contained in this Software
       ("WM-DRM") to protect the integrity of their content
       ("Secure Content") so that their intellectual property,
       including copyright, in such content is not 
       misappropriated. Portions of this Software and third 
       party applications such as media players use WM-DRM to 
       play Secure Content ("WM-DRM Software").  If the WM-DRM
       Software's security has been compromised, owners of 
       Secure Content ("Secure Content Owners") may request that
       Microsoft revoke the WM-DRM Software's right to copy, 
       display and/or play Secure Content.  Revocation does not 
       alter the WM-DRM Software's ability to play unprotected 
       content. A list of revoked WM-DRM Software is sent to 
       your computer whenever you download a license for Secure
       Content from the Internet.  Microsoft may, in
       conjunction with such license, also download revocation
       lists onto your computer on behalf of Secure Content
       Owners.  Secure Content Owners may also require you
       to upgrade some of the WM-DRM components in this
       Software ("WM-DRM Upgrades") before accessing their
       content.  When you attempt to play such content, WM-DRM
       Software built by Microsoft will notify you that a
       WM-DRM Upgrade is required and then ask for your consent
       before the WM-DRM Upgrade is downloaded.  WM-DRM 
       Software built by third parties may do the same.  If you 
       decline the upgrade, you will not be able to access 
       content that requires the WM-DRM Upgrade; however, you 
       will still be able to access unprotected content and 
       Secure Content that does not require the upgrade.  WM-DRM 
       features that access the Internet, such as  acquiring new
       licenses and/or performing a required WM-DRM Upgrade, can
       be switched off.  When these features are switched off,
       you will still be able to play Secure Content if you have
       a valid license for such content already stored on your 
       computer.

       (v) Windows Media Player.  Some features of Windows Media
       Player automatically contact Microsoft computer systems
       if you use Windows Media Player or specific features
       of it:  features that (A) check for new codecs if your
       Server does not have the correct ones for content you
       attempt to play (this feature may be switched off),
       and (B) check for new versions of Windows Media Player
       (this feature will operate only when you are using
       Windows Media Player).

    d. Benchmark Testing.  The 32-bit version of the Software
    contain the Microsoft .NET Framework.  Disclosure of the
    results of any benchmark test of the .NET Framework
    component of the Software to any third party without
    Microsoft's prior written approval is prohibited.

    e. Reservation of Rights; Other Restrictions. The Software is
    protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws
    and treaties.  Microsoft or its suppliers own the title,
    copyright, and other intellectual property rights in the
    Software.  The Software is licensed, not sold.  Microsoft
    reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this
    EULA.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this EULA,
    neither this EULA nor any CAL grants a license, under any
    Microsoft intellectual property, to implement any
    functionality contained in the Software (including without
    limitation communication protocols used by the Software)
    in any software installed on a Device accessing or
    utilizing the Server Software.  Reverse engineering,
    decompiling, or disassembling the Software
    is prohibited, except and only to the extent that such 
    activity is expressly permitted by applicable law 
    notwithstanding this limitation. Renting, leasing, or 
    lending the Software (including providing commercial 
    hosting services) is also prohibited.

 5. PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES

    the Software.  Microsoft does not control the third party
    sites, and Microsoft is not responsible for the contents
    of any third party sites, any links contained in third
    party sites, or any changes or updates to third party
    sites.  Microsoft is not responsible for web-casting or any
    other form of transmission received from any third party
    sites.  Microsoft is providing you these links to third
    party sites to you only as a convenience, and the
    inclusion of any link does not imply an endorsement by 
    Microsoft of the third party site.

 7. UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES

    a. Software upgrades generally.  To use Software identified
    as an upgrade by Microsoft, it is required that you be
    licensed for the software identified by Microsoft as
    eligible for the upgrade.  After upgrading, the software
    that formed the basis for your upgrade eligibility may no
    longer be used.  The resulting upgraded Software may be used
    only in accordance with the terms of this EULA.

    b. Software upgrades for a component of Microsoft BackOffice
    Server ("BackOffice Server").  To use any Software as an
    upgrade to a component of BackOffice Server, then the
    requirements of this paragraph apply in addition to those
    in the paragraph above.  If you upgrade to the Software
    from BackOffice Server, the remaining components may only
    be used in accordance with the terms of the Microsoft End
    User License Agreement that accompanied BackOffice Server.
    After an upgrade of BackOffice Server, all Software must
    run on the same Server on which BackOffice Server is
    installed, unless the upgrade is an Enterprise Edition,
    in which case you may use the Software as stand-alone 
    software in accordance with the terms of this EULA.

    c. Software downgrades.  Instead of installing and using the
    Server Software, you may install and use one copy of an
    earlier version of the Server Software on a single Server,
    provided that such earlier version is no earlier than
    Windows NT version 4.0, and that you completely remove such
    earlier version and install the Server Software within a
    reasonable time.  Your use of such earlier version shall
    be governed by this EULA, where applicable, and your
    rights to use such earlier version shall terminate when you
    install the current version of Server Software.

    d. CAL downgrades.  You may use Windows Device CALs and
    Windows User CALs with an earlier version of the Software
    in accordance with the terms of this EULA.  You may use TS
    Device CALs, but due to technical incompatibilities not TS
    User CALs, with earlier versions of the Software in
    accordance with the terms of this EULA.

 8. NOT FOR RESALE SOFTWARE.  Software
    identified as "Not for Resale" or "NFR," may not be sold
    or otherwise transferred for value or used for any purpose
    other than demonstration, test or evaluation.

11. SOFTWARE TRANSFER-Internal transfer.  You may move the
    Server Software to a different Server as long as you
    permanently remove the software from the initial Server.
    Transfer to Third Party.  The initial user of the Software
    may make a one-time permanent transfer of this EULA and
    Software to another end user, provided the initial user retains
    no copies of the Software.  The transfer must include all of
    the Software (including all component parts, the media and
    printed materials, any upgrades, this EULA, and, if
    applicable, the Certificate of Authenticity).  The
    transfer may not be an indirect transfer, such as a

    ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, if the
    Software does not meet Microsoft's Limited Warranty, and,
    to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, even if
    any remedy fails of its essential purpose.  The terms of
    Section 16 ("Exclusion of Incidental, Consequential and
    Certain Other Damages") are also incorporated into this
    Limited Warranty. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow
    the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
    damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not 
    apply to you.  This Limited Warranty gives you specific 
    legal rights.  You may have other rights which vary from 
    state/jurisdiction to state/jurisdiction.

    YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.  Microsoft's and
    its suppliers' entire liability and your exclusive remedy
    for any breach of this Limited Warranty or for any other
    breach of this EULA or for any other liability relating to
    the Software shall be, at Microsoft's option from time to
    time exercised subject to applicable law, (a) return of the
    amount paid (if any) for the Software, or (b) repair or
    replacement of the Software, that does not meet this
    Limited Warranty and that is returned to Microsoft with a
    copy of your receipt.  You will receive the remedy elected
    by Microsoft without charge, except that you are
    responsible for any expenses you may incur (e.g., cost of
    shipping the Software to Microsoft).  This Limited Warranty
    is void if failure of the Software has resulted from
    accident, abuse, misapplication, abnormal use or a virus. 
    Any replacement Software will be warranted for the
    remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30)
    days, whichever is longer, and Microsoft will use
    commercially reasonable efforts to provide your remedy
    within a commercially reasonable time of your compliance
    with Microsoft's warranty remedy procedures.  Outside
    the United States or Canada, neither these remedies nor any
    product support services offered by Microsoft are available
    without proof of purchase from an authorized international
    source.  To exercise your remedy, contact:  
    Microsoft, Attn. Microsoft Sales Information Center/
    One Microsoft Way/Redmond, WA 98052-6399, or
    the Microsoft subsidiary serving your country.

15. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  The Limited
    Warranty that appears above is the only express warranty
    made to you and is provided in lieu of any other express
    warranties or similar obligations (if any) created by any
    advertising, documentation, packaging, or other
    communications.  Except for the Limited Warranty and to the
    maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Microsoft and
    its suppliers provide the Software and support services (if
    any) AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS, and
    hereby disclaim all other warranties and conditions,
    whether express, implied or statutory, including, but not
    limited to, any (if any) implied warranties, duties or
    conditions of merchantability, of fitness for a particular
    purpose, of reliability or availability, of accuracy or
    completeness of responses, of results, of workmanlike
    effort, of lack of viruses, and of lack of negligence, all
    with regard to the Software, and the provision of or
    failure to provide support or other services, information,
    software, and related content through the Software or 
    otherwise arising out of the use of the Software.  
    ALSO, THERE IS NO WARRANTY OR CONDITION
    OF TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, QUIET 
    POSSESSION, CORRESPONDENCE TO DESCRIPTION
    OR NON-INFRINGEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE 
    SOFTWARE.

16. EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL

    NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT YOU
    MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER
    (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL
    DAMAGES REFERENCED HEREIN AND ALL
    DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES IN CONTRACT

Si vous avez acquis votre produit Microsoft au CANADA, la
garantie limitée suivante s'applique :

GARANTIE LIMITÉE

Microsoft garantit que le Logiciel fonctionnera conformément aux
documents inclus pendant une période de 90 jours suivant la date
de réception.

Si une garantie ou condition implicite est créée par votre État
ou votre territoire et qu'une loi fédérale ou provinciale ou d'un
État en interdit le déni, vous jouissez également d'une garantie
ou condition implicite, MAIS UNIQUEMENT POUR
LES DÉFAUTS DÉCOUVERTS DURANT LA PÉRIODE DE
LA PRÉSENTE GARANTIE LIMITÉE (QUATRE-VINGT
-DIX JOURS). IL N'Y A AUCUNE GARANTIE OU
CONDITION DE QUELQUE NATURE QUE CE SOIT QUANT
AUX DÉFAUTS DÉCOUVERTS APRÈS CETTE PÉRIODE DE
QUATRE-VINGT-DIX JOURS. Certains États ou
territoires ne permettent pas de limiter la durée d'une garantie
ou condition implicite de sorte que la limitation ci­dessus peut
ne pas s'appliquer à vous.

Tous les suppléments ou toutes les mises à jour relatifs au
Logiciel, notamment, les ensembles de services ou les réparations
à chaud (le cas échéant) qui vous sont fournis après l'expiration
de la période de quatre-vingt-dix jours de la garantie limitée ne
sont pas couverts par quelque garantie ou condition que ce soit,
expresse, implicite ou en vertu de la loi.

LIMITATION DES RECOURS; ABSENCE DE DOMMAGES
INDIRECTS OU AUTRES.  Votre recours exclusif pour toute violation
de la présente garantie limitée est décrit ci­après. Sauf pour
tout remboursement au choix de Microsoft, si le Logiciel ne
respecte pas la garantie limitée de Microsoft et, dans la mesure
maximale permise par les lois applicables, même si tout recours
n'atteint pas son but essentiel, VOUS N'AVEZ DROIT À AUCUNS
DOMMAGES, NOTAMMENT DES DOMMAGES INDIRECTS.
Les termes  de la clause "Exclusion des dommages accessoires,
indirects et de certains autres dommages " sont également
intégrées à la présente garantie limitée. Certains États ou
territoires ne permettent pas l'exclusion ou la limitation des
dommages indirects ou accessoires de sorte que la limitation ou
l'exclusion ci­dessus peut ne pas s'appliquer à vous. La présente
garantie limitée vous donne des droits légaux spécifiques. Vous
pouvez avoir d'autres droits qui peuvent varier d'un territoire
ou d'un État à un autre.

VOTRE RECOURS EXCLUSIF.  La seule
responsabilité obligation de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs et
votre recours exclusif  pour toute violation de la présente
garantie limitée ou pour toute autre violation du présent contrat
ou pour toute autre responsabilité relative au Logiciel seront,
selon le choix de Microsoft exercé de temps à autre sous réserve
de toute loi applicable, a) le remboursement du prix payé, le cas
échéant, pour le Logiciel ou b) la réparation ou le remplacement
du Logiciel qui ne respecte pas la présente garantie limitée et
qui est retourné à Microsoft avec une copie de votre reçu.  Vous
recevrez la compensation choisie par Microsoft, sans frais, sauf
que vous êtes responsable des dépenses que vous pourriez engager
(p. ex., les frais d'envoi du Logiciel à Microsoft). La présente
garantie limitée est nulle si la défectuosité du Logiciel est
causée par un accident, un usage abusif, une mauvaise
application, un usage anormal ou un virus. Tout Logiciel de
remplacement sera garanti pour le reste de la période initiale de
la garantie ou pendant trente (30) jours, selon la plus longue
entre ces deux périodes. À l'extérieur des États-Unis ou du
Canada, ces recours ou l'un quelconque des services de soutien
technique offerts par Microsoft ne sont pas disponibles sans
preuve d'achat d'une source internationale autorisée. Pour
exercer votre recours, vous devez communiquer avec Microsoft et
vous adresser au Microsoft Sales Information Center/One Microsoft
Way/Redmond, WA 98052-6399, ou à la filiale de Microsoft de votre
pays.

DÉNI DE GARANTIES.  La garantie limitée qui apparaît ci-dessus
constitue la seule garantie expresse qui vous est donnée et
remplace toutes autres garanties expresses (s'il en est) crées
par une publicité, un document,  un emballage ou une autre
communication. Sauf en ce qui a trait à la garantie limitée et
dans la mesure maximale permise par les lois applicables, le
Logiciel et les services de soutien technique (le cas échéant)
sont fournis TELS QUELS ET AVEC TOUS LES
DÉFAUTS par Microsoft et ses fournisseurs, lesquels par les
présentes dénient toutes autres garanties et conditions
expresses, implicites ou en vertu de la loi, notamment, mais sans
limitation, (le cas échéant) les garanties, devoirs ou conditions
implicites de qualité marchande, d'adaptation à une fin
particulière,  de fiabilité ou de disponibilité, d'exactitude ou
d'exhaustivité des réponses, des résultats, des efforts déployés
selon les règles de l'art, d'absence de virus et d'absence de
négligence, le tout à l'égard du Logiciel et de la prestation ou
de l'omission de la  prestation des services de soutien technique
ou à l'égard de la fourniture ou de l'omission de la fourniture
de tous autres services, renseignements, logiciels, et contenu
qui s'y rapporte  grâce au Logiciel ou provenant autrement de
l'utilisation du Logiciel. PAR AILLEURS, IL N'Y A AUCUNE
GARANTIE OU CONDITION QUANT AU TITRE DE
PROPRIÉTÉ, À LA JOUISSANCE OU LA POSSESSION
PAISIBLE, À LA CONCORDANCE À UNE DESCRIPTION
NI QUANT À UNE ABSENCE DE CONTREFAÇON
CONCERNANT LE LOGICIEL.

The following MICROSOFT GUARANTEE applies to you if you
acquired this Software in any other country:

Statutory rights not affected - The following guarantee is not
restricted to any territory and does not affect any statutory
rights that you may have from your reseller or from Microsoft if
you acquired the Software directly from Microsoft.  If you
acquired the Software or any support services in Australia, New
Zealand or Malaysia, please see the "Consumer rights"
section below.
       
The guarantee - The Software is designed and offered as
a general-purpose software, not for any user's particular
purpose.  You accept that no Software is error free and you are
strongly advised to back-up your files regularly.  Provided that
you have a valid license, Microsoft guarantees that (a) for a
period of 90 days from the date of receipt of your license to use
the Software or the shortest period permitted by applicable law
it will perform substantially in accordance with the written
materials that accompany the Software; and (b) any support
services provided by Microsoft shall be substantially as
described in applicable written materials provided to you by
Microsoft and Microsoft support engineers will use reasonable
efforts, care and skill to solve any problem issues.  In the
event that the Software fails to comply with this guarantee,
Microsoft will either (a) repair or replace the Software or (b)
return the price you paid.  This guarantee is void if failure of
the Software results from accident, abuse or misapplication.  Any
replacement Software will be guaranteed for the remainder of the
original guarantee period or 30 days, whichever period is longer. 
You agree that the above guarantee is your sole guarantee in
relation to the Software and any support services.

Exclusion of All Other Terms - To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law and subject to the guarantee above, Microsoft
disclaims all warranties, conditions and other terms, either
express or implied (whether by statute, common law, collaterally
or otherwise) including but not limited to implied warranties of
satisfactory quality and fitness for particular purpose with
respect to the Software and the written materials that accompany
the Software.  Any implied warranties that cannot be excluded are
limited to 90 days or to the shortest period permitted by
applicable law, whichever is greater.

Limitation of Liability - To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law and except as provided in the Microsoft Guarantee,
Microsoft and its suppliers shall not be liable for any damages
whatsoever (including without limitation, damages for loss of
business profits, business interruption, loss of business
information or other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use or
inability to use the Software, even if Microsoft has been advised
of the possibility of such damages.  In any case Microsoft's
entire liability under any provision of this Agreement shall be
limited to the amount actually paid by you for the Software. 
These limitations do not apply to any liabilities that cannot be
excluded or limited by applicable laws.

Consumer rights - Consumers in Australia, New Zealand or Malaysia
may have the benefit of certain rights and remedies by reason of
the Trade Practices Act and similar state and territory laws in
Australia, the Consumer Guarantees Act in New Zealand and the
Consumer Protection Act in Malaysia in respect of which liability
cannot lawfully be modified or excluded.  If you acquired the
Software in New Zealand for the purposes of a business, you
confirm that the Consumer Guarantees Act does not apply.  If you
acquired the Software in Australia and if Microsoft breaches a
condition or warranty implied under any law which cannot lawfully
be modified or excluded by this agreement then, to the extent
permitted by law, Microsoft's liability is limited, at
Microsoft's option, to: (i) in the case of the Software: (a)
repairing or replacing the Software; or (b) the cost of such
repair or replacement; and (ii) in the case of support services:
(a) re-supply of the services; or (b) the cost of having the
services supplied again.
