[VENDOR_IDS]
; The Vendor IDs (also known as OUI's) were extracted from
; http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/oui.txt and were current as of March 1, 1999
; No attempt was made to correct the vendor identification. Names were truncated to
; 6 characters to match internal format of vendor ids.
; You can add 1000 vendor IDs to the 2917 IDs currently stored internally.
; You can also alter existing company names, and 6 chararacter identifiers
; The Vendor ID numbers can only be 6 characters.  The names must also fit in 6 chars
; An example entry list would look like:
; NumberIDs = 1
; VID0= 002211, 6ChrNm, Full Company Name
; Note that making this a long list will slow the startup of Network Monitor
NumberIDs   =0
