      If you change this parameter, you must stop and then restart the POP3 service. You can manage the POP3 service from <B>Services</b> on the <B>Administrative Tools</b> menu, which you can access by logging on locally to the server or by connecting to the server using Terminal Services.

<P>Active Directory integrated authentication and local Windows accounts authentication support both plaintext and Secure Password Authentication (SPA) e-mail client authentication.</P>

<P>Plaintext authentication transmits the user's credentials in an unsecured, unencrypted format. Because Secure Password Authentication requires that e-mail clients transmit both the user name and password using secure authentication, it is recommended over plaintext authentication.</P>
