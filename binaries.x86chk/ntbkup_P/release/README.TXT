NTBackup Backup/Restore and ASR release notes

Backup/Restore

ASR

1.	ASR is not supported on home edition.

IF you install NtBackup from the CD to the Home Edition, ASR functionality will appear to work fine during
the backup session.  Since the setup does not support ASR in the home edition, there is no way to initiate
the ASR restore in case of a disaster. If you need to restore from this session, install Windows XP manually
and then restore from the ASR media.

2.      Backup to CDRW

If you decide to backup to a CDRW, you cannot target that device directly.  You must create a backup set of
650MB or less and backup to a file.  After the file is complete, copy the file to the CDRW.

Please refer to the readme for XP home edition for additional notes.
