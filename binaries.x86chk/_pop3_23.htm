<H1>Lock a Domain</H1>

<P>You can lock a domain to prevent all users in the domain from connecting to the mail server and retrieving their email.  When a domain is locked, the POP3 service still receives incoming e-mail for the domain and delivers it to the appropriate mailbox directory in the mail store. Outgoing mail from mailboxes in the domain is still sent through the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) service. Also, while a domain is locked, you can still perform administrative tasks such as deleting a domain.</P>
