<H1>Lock a Mailbox</H1>

<P>You can lock a mailbox to prevent a user from retrieving e-mail.  A locked mailbox still receives incoming e-mail, but the user will not be allowed to connect to the server and retrieve e-mail. While a mailbox is locked, the only restriction is that the user cannot connect to the mail server. You can still perform all administrative tasks, such as deleting a mailbox or changing the password for a mailbox.</P>
