      If you change this parameter, you must stop and then restart the POP3 service. You can manage the POP3 service from <B>Services</b> on the <B>Administrative Tools</b> menu, which you can access by logging on locally to the server or by connecting to the server using Terminal Services.

<P>The server port is the port that the POP3 service uses to monitor for e-mail clients and to respond to connection requests. Do not change this port from its default of 110, the Internet standard, unless you have a specific need to do so. If you change this port, you must inform all users that you are using a non-standard port because most e-mail clients configure port 110 as the default for connecting to a server running the POP3 service.
